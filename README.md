A ``singledispatch()`` for arguments that are classes annotated as specific types.

Inspired by https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100623.

# A simple example
Use `functools.singledispatch` to singledispatch classes as parameters.

While `functools.singledispatch` examines the class of the first user argument,
`class_singledispatch` uses the first argument as the class itself and performs
the same task with it as `functools.singledispatch`.

```python
from class_singledispatch import class_singledispatch


class T:
    pass


class OtherT:
    pass


@class_singledispatch
def on_class(cls: type[T], /) -> None:
    print("T!")


@on_class.register
def on_other_class(cls: type[OtherT], /) -> None:
    print("OtherT!")


# Useful for <=3.10, as soon as `@class_singledispatch` allows specifying
# the class similarly to `.register` -- pass the class to the decorator
# not to use the annotation from the function for the targeted class resolution
@on_class.register(SomeOtherT)
def on_some_other_class(cls: type[SomeOtherT], /) -> None:
    print("SomeOtherT!")


on_class(T)  # T!
on_class(OtherT)  #  OtherT!
on_class(SomeOtherT)  #  SomeOtherT!
```

> If you use Windows, it is highly recommended to complete the installation in the way presented below through [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).



1.  Fork the [class_singledispatch repository](https://github.com/bswck/class_singledispatch) on GitHub.

1.  [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).<br/>
    Poetry is an amazing tool for managing dependencies & virtual environments, building packages and publishing them.
    You might use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#readme) to install it globally (recommended):

    ```shell
    pipx install poetry
    ```

    <sub>If you encounter any problems, refer to [the official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for the most up-to-date installation instructions.</sub>

    Be sure to have Python 3.8 installed‚Äîif you use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#readme), simply run:

    ```shell
    pyenv install 3.8
    ```

1.  Clone your fork locally and install dependencies.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/class_singledispatch path/to/class_singledispatch
    cd path/to/class_singledispatch
    poetry env use $(cat .python-version)
    poetry install
    ```

    Next up, simply activate the virtual environment and install pre-commit hooks:

    ```shell
    poetry shell
    pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
    ```
